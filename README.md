Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio! 

## Projects
In the following you can find a list of projects developed during my MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence at San Diego University. 

### Study_Of_Obesity - [Github Link]()

Final Project of the course "Probability and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence"

We analyzed an [existing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) including 17 attributes possibly linked to different weight levels (underweight, normal, overweight I, overweight II, obesity I, obesity II and obesity III) to identify the most important factors related to overweight and obesity. Then a decision tree classifier was tested to predict if one is overweight/obese or not based on the most influential attributes associated to overweight/obesity identified at the first step (number of meals per day, daily water consumption, physical activity frequency per week, time using technology per day, age and height). The model exhibits an accuracy of 85% and the values for precision, recall and f1-score are 0.9/0.72, 0.89/0.74 and 0.89/0.73 for people suffering/not suffering from overweight or obesity. 

### Text_To_Image - [Github Link](https://github.com/CatGallo/Text_To_Image.git) - [Application Deployment](https://huggingface.co/sglasher/van-gogh-stable-diffusion)

Final Project of the course of "Introduction to Computer Vision" 

We developed a text-to-image model able to generate Van Gogh style pictures based on text prompts. We exploited a pre-trained model of Stable Diffusion available in Hugging Face, and fine-tuned it on a dataset of images and descriptions including  more than 400 Van Gogh's masterpieces. The model was quantitatively evaluated through a couple of metrics normally used for diffusion models: the [CLIP score](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/evaluation) (28.89) and the [Fréchet Inception Distance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/evaluation) (677.19). In order to assess the quality of the output images, different users were also asked to evaluate the output images by assigning a score from 1 to 5 to five different criteria: relevance to the initial prompt (4.56 ± 0.7), Van Gogh style (3.94 ± 1.34), complexity (4.0 ± 0.87), creativity (4.0 ± 1.12), and general satisfaction (4.38 ± 0.78).
