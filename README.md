Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio! 

## Projects
In the following you can find a list of projects developed during my MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence at San Diego University. 

### Text_To_Image - [Github Link]() - [Application Deployment](https://huggingface.co/sglasher/van-gogh-stable-diffusion)

Final Project of the course of Introduction to Computer Vision (2023)

We developed a text-to-image model able to generate Van Gogh style pictures based on text prompts. We exploited a pre-trained model of Stable Diffusion available in Hugging Face, and fine-tuned it on a dataset of images and descriptions including  more than 400 Van Gogh's masterpieces. The model was quantitatively evaluated through a couple of metrics normally used for diffusion models: the [CLIP score](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/evaluation) (28.89) and the [Fréchet Inception Distance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/evaluation) (677.19). In order to assess the quality of the output images, different users were also asked to evaluate the output images by assigning a score from 1 to 5 to five different criteria: relevance to the initial prompt (4.56 ± 0.7), Van Gogh style (3.94 ± 1.34), complexity (4.0 ± 0.87), creativity (4.0 ± 1.12), and general satisfaction (4.38 ± 0.78).
