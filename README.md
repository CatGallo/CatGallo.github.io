Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio! 

## Projects
In the following you can find a list of projects developed during my MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence at San Diego University. 

### TEXT TO IMAGE 
Final Project of the course of Introduction to Computer Vision (2023)
It is a text-to-image model to generate Van Gogh style pictures based on text prompts. It exploits a pre-trained model of Stable Diffusion available in Hugging Face, then fine-tuned on a dataset of images and descriptions of more than 400 Van Gogh's masterpieces. The model was quantitatively evaluted through a couple of metrics normally used for diffusion models: the [CLIP score](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/evaluation) (28.89) and the [Fr√©chet Inception Distance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/evaluation) (677.19).
